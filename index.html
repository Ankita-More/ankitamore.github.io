          <h2>Python Programming Language</h2>
          <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.</p>

        <div class="skill-item">
          <div class="icon"><img src="images/sql.png" /></div>
          <h2>Structural Query Language (SQL)</h2>
          <p>SQL is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. SQL can be used to insert, search, update, and delete database records. SQL can do lots of other operations, including optimizing and maintenance of databases.</p>

          <h2>Analytics with Python</h2>
          <p>A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.</p>

          <div class="icon"><img src="images/machine learning.png" /></div>
          <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
          <p>Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="skill-item">
          <div class="icon"><img src="images/deep learning.jpg" /></div>
          <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
          <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.</p>

        <div class="skill-item">
          <div class="icon"><img src="images/nlp.jpg" /></div>
          <h2>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h2>
          <p>NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, which is a part of Computer Science, Human language, and Artificial Intelligence. It is the technology that is used by machines to understand, analyse, manipulate, and interpret human's languages. It helps developers to organize knowledge for performing tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), speech recognition, relationship extraction, and topic segmentation.

            <h2>Travel Package Prediction (Machine Learning)</h2>
            <p>To analyze the customers' data and information to provide
              recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team
              and also build a model to predict the potential customer
              who is going to purchase the newly introduced travel
              package.
              By doing EDA & Pre-processing, cleaned the dataset and
              drawn insights out of it.
              Ensemble techniques like AdaBoost Classifier,
              GradientBoost Classifier, XGBClassifier have given more
              accuracy to the model.

            <h2>Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)</h2>
            <p>-A bank wants to build a machine learning model which 
              can predict whether a particular customer will churn or
              not. For that bank wants to know which existing
              customers have the highest probability of leaving the
              company.
              -Using EDA and Pre-Processing of data, cleaned the
              dataset and removed skewness in order to get effective
              prediction results.
              -Using classification algorithms and ensemble
              techniques trained the dataset and got more accuracy
              from Support Vector Machine and Ensemble Techniques.
